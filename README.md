### Bonjour, le monde&nbsp;!

I mainly write in Rust and TypeScript. When I’m not, then I'm writing interactive fictions in French!

- Most of my “serious” open-source projects are [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Natrium729).
- My other projects are [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Natrium729).
- I only use GitHub when contributing to projects that are on GitHub.
